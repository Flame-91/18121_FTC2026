# 18121 FTC 2026 Codebase â€“ Decode Season

Welcome to the official codebase for FTC Team 18121 Flame during the 2026 "Centerstage: Decode" season.  
This repository builds on top of [PedroPathing Quickstart](https://github.com/pedroSG94/Quickstart) and uses [FTCLib](https://github.com/FTCLib/FTCLib) to implement a clean, modular, and high-performance command-based robot architecture.

This project represents our team's competitive software foundation for both autonomous and driver-controlled periods.
